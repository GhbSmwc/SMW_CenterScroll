	-rerelease the patch with sa-1 support.
1/11/2016
	-Alcaro pointed out that this patch has a flaw on the gfx+2 patch conflict, he
	 said this:

	;----quote----;
	This patch requires the gfx+2 patch to be installed at a very specific location.
	By default, the patch is inserted exactly there, but I suspect it's not if the
	ROM is expanded to 4MB. Either way, fix your nonsensical requirements, GHB. Use
	assert read1($00F6E4) == $5C and org read3($00F6E5). And double check the SA-1
	support, you missed the assert there and I suspect you may have missed more.
	;----end_quote----;

	This means that:
	-The center scroll patch's assert thinks you haven't saved a level if gfx+2 patch's
	 location isn't in a specific freespace area.
	-After expanding your rom for SA-1, LM still doesn't insert the scroll hijack until
	 you have saved a level, this could break the scrolling routine if inserted before
	 saving in a sa-1 rom.
	-Discovered why the "save level once" check fails to work on a sa-1 rom, you must
	 use "sa1rom" command BEFORE ANY of the rom addresses, so that it tells asar to
	 remap ALL the address below/after the command to be adopted to sa-1.
1/15/2016
	-Minor fix: the example explaining on how to get codes to be compatable with this
	 had a typo using a double-period.
3/18/2016
	-Added a new feature that you can now see the bottom row of 16x16 blocks in
	 horizontal levels.
	-Added an advanced version. This new one is based on ram address and the vertical
	 scrolling's static camera region is also reduced.
3/20/2016
	-Fix an inconsistency with the "no vertical scroll unless flying/climbing/etc."
	 setting. While the scree's Y position value is more than #$00C0 (along the bottom
	 of the level), the screen is able to scroll up #$0010 pixels without flying,
	 climbing/etc. This happens also on the SMB3 status bar.
	-Fix a displacement issue that if you transfer from a level that has "vertical
	 scroll at will" to a level that has no vertical scroll, the screen scrolls to
	 look for mario for 1 frame during black screen, messing up horizontal layer 2
	 levels.
3/30/2016
	-Fix a fatel glitch with CenterScroll.asm, where the hijack $00F88F wasn't valid:
		;----code----;
		CODE_00F88D:        B0 03         BCS CODE_00F892           
		CODE_00F88F:        B9 A7 F6      LDA.W DATA_00F6A7,Y       
		CODE_00F892:        18            CLC                       
		CODE_00F893:        65 1C         ADC RAM_ScreenBndryYLo    
		;----end_code----;
	 If BCS CODE_00F892 branches, it would branch into a portion of the JML; reading
	 it incorrectly.
1/13/2017 - 2.0
	-Edited the lowest inital y positon to adopt with the new lowest Y positon in
	 level.
	-Now uses the latest version of sprite scroll fix.
	-Added a new center scroll patch named "CenterScrollAdvanced_NonInstant.asm", which
	 allows the player to change position a few blocks away without graphical glitches
	 since the screen no longer instantly jolts.

2/10/2017
	-Added a note about some sprites that are screen-position relative that they are
	 adjusted on this readme.
8/17/2017 - 2.2
	-Fix a bug on the two CenterScrollAdvanced patches that caused the layer 2 inital
	 Y position to be 1 tile lower than it should be (provided that the screen wasn't
	 scrolled during non-constant Y scroll) when having layer 1 and 2 at the lowest
	 position possible (lower down = higher Y value).
12/29/2018 - 3.0
	-Merged all 3 patches into one, and the options are in the form of defines.
	-Fixed a pointless org hijack: org $00F72D and org $00F72C. The first one can be
	 removed.
	-Adapted the patch to work properly in LM v3.00. Most of the major changes are:
	--LM makes jumps in the code that are essentially substituting them (it skips SMW's code
	  and runs it's own freespace code instead).
	--Because LM V3.00 fixes a lot of layer 2-related Y position issues and enables the
	  camera to scroll down to see the bottom row in horizontal levels, the old hijacks
	  are now obsolete as LM is in charge for fixing SMW's "bugs" and other quirks.
4/14/2019
	-Fix a crashing bug on LM 3.03 that if you move the player's spawning position then
	 save, the hijack at $009708 gets changed and breaks with this hijack of this patch:
		;----code----;
			org read3($009708+1)+$12	;\Above hijack commented out due to LM adding jumps to skip
			autoclean JSL InitScrollPos	;|codes this patch relies on, thus have to edit LM code instead.
			nop #2				;/(not sure why sometimes the above hijacks only executes or this one).
		;----end_code----;
	 As the +$12 offset from the start of the LM freespace code must be changed to +$15
	 since new code was added before doing LDA #$0080 : STA $142A, therefore moving it
	 3 bytes later.
